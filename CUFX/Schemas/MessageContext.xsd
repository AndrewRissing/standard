				The MessageContext contains information that is passed as part of each CUFX message call.
				All the fields are optional, and whether or not they contain information is determined byt he specific implementation requirements.
				For example, in a multitenant environment where multiple financial institutions are hosted, the Financial Institution ID (FIID) may be a required field, necessary for distinguishing which FI the message pertains to.  For a single tenant environment with only one financial institution, the Financial Institution ID may not be necessary.

			<xs:element name="requestID" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>
						The request id is unique identifier which identifies the request from the source system. The client application sends this along with the messages so that it can be logged as a reference for troubleshooting purposes.

				</xs:annotation>
			</xs:element>
			<xs:element name="vendorID" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>
						The vendor id is unique identifier which identifies the vendor that is creating a message. The vendor id is assigned by the FI or establised in concert by the vendor and FI.
						The client application sends this along with the messages so that logging or other business may take place based on the vendor  utilizing the service.
						This id is not generated per data or security request but is generated &quot;out-of-band&quot; (i.e., prior generation by some external mechanism) of this process and stored in the Financial Institution&apos;s and Vendor’s systems.
						A standard error will be returned if the vendorId is not provided when it is required.

				</xs:annotation>
			</xs:element>
			<xs:element name="appID" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>
						The app id is an &quot;agreed upon&quot; unique identifier that identifies the application that is creating a message.
						The client application sends this along with the messages so that logging or other business may take place based on the application utilizing the service.
						This id is not generated per data or security request but is generated &quot;out-of-band&quot; (i.e., prior generation by some external mechanism) of this process and stored in the Financial Institution&apos;s and Vendor’s systems.
						A standard error will be returned if the appId is not provided when it is required.

			<xs:element name="fiID" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>
						The fiId  is used by systems to uniquely identify each financial institution.
						This id is determined outside of the process and stored in each system of record, e.g., local application database, vendor configuration file, FI core database,etc.
						This is helpful for applications that are multi-tenant and service more than one financial institution.
						See dataSourceId for more info about multiple data sources for a single FI.
						A standard error will be returned if the fiId is not provided when it is required.

				</xs:annotation>
			</xs:element>
			<xs:element name="dataSourceID" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>
						The dataSourceId  is used by the systems to uniquely identify a registered data source within the financial institution.
						This is an agreed upon id determined outside of the process and stored in each system of record.
						There may be more than one data source id per financial institution.
						For instance, one dataSourceId may represent the financial institution’s core provider and another may be used to represent the credit card provider that is not within the core.  i.e.
						There may be a one-to-many relationship between fiID  and dataSourceId.

            Applicable to creates and updates.  The return data filter is used to streamline the amount of
            information to return to the client after an update or create.  The client can request
            all data from the object, only fields that were updated or created, or no data (just a confirmation that it was successful).

			<xs:element name="user" type="User" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>
						Collection of user(s) associated to a message.
						Typically, there will be only one user associated to a message request, but providing the flexibility in case future use cases have two user Id’s associated to one message.

				</xs:annotation>
			</xs:element>
			<xs:element name="customData" type="common:CustomData" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>
						The customData section allows the flexibility to add additional information to the messageContext.
						This should be utilized as a last resort and any use should result in requested modifications to the message or messageContext .
						Note: that typically the data required will be in the message (such as party id, accountId, etc.) rather than contained in the messageContext.

						FI_USER_ID would be used in the case a consumer is trying to perform functions via online banking.
