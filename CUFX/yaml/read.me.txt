The cufx.Swagger.yaml.txt file is formated in version 2.0 yaml for import into Swaggerhub. The file is produced as a 
result of 6 Powershell scripts that parses the entire xsd library, builds the simple and complex definitions, tags and header entries. 
The process essentially builds hundreds of text file components and then fully resturctures and reintegrates into the yaml format. 
While every effort has been made to ensure that the yaml file is consistent and accurately represents the xsd base, it is possible for
some variation to exist. In any case where there is a variance in definition, intention or behavior. The XSD source file will be the 
prevailing record of fact.
